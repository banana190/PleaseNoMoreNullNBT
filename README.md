# PleaseNoMoreNullNBT    

## Status: Work in Progress    
This project aims to address an issue where players are unable to log into a Forge 1.20.1 server intermittently, due to the following error:

''internal exception java.lang.nullpointerexception can not invoke "net.minecraft.nbt.compoundtag.m_128459_(string)" because "nbt" is null''         

The goal is to automatically identify which mod(s) are causing this issue, let you to begin troubleshooting and fixing the problem asap.     

## Current Status     
The tool is currently designed to operate with both client and server running on the same machine. Future updates will aim to enable testing in a separate environment.
